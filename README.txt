UPDATED 3/07/16. Edited.


Recently Done:
1. Created "profile.php". This is the user's personal page.
	a. Connected partially to database. Still need to do Reviews
	b. Styled profile.php in "css/profileStyle.css"
2. Setup file storage of images for items and profile pictures
	FYI: profile pictures are stored as "email@address.com" + file extension. Example: "imgs/test@test.com.png"
	     Item images are stored using "item id" + "file name" + "extension". Example "11testpants.png"
	a. Also connected this to database
	b. Put file methods in "fileutils.php"
3. Setup email verification upon registration. i.e two accounts can't exist with same email
4. Lots of css all over the place


NOTES/STEPS of what to do NEXT
.

1. Set up in-depth product page/search
2. Documentation. One of us needs to go back and better comment each page
3. Figure out how to show different content for different user profile page vs their own profile page
4. CSS. Lots of styling left to do. 
5. Bug checking. We should create more test users and see if we see errors.
6. Create a new table with item id's and image links. This will allow for an item to have multiple images
7. Categories
	a. Probably should make a new table that has item id & category. This allows for one item to be in 		multiple categories
	b. Integrate that table with appropriate php files
	c. Shopping page has to show only content with particular categories that are checked off
8. Make it so certain pages don't display if the user is not logged in. This shouldn't be too hard
8. ??? Lots of other stuff that I'm sure we'll find along the way. Overall, we are in awesome shape.
